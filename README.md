## About

`spock` is a framework that helps manage complex parameter configurations during research and development of Python 
applications. `spock` let's you focus on the code you need to write instead of re-implementing boilerplate code like 
creating ArgParsers, reading configuration files, implementing traceability etc.

In short, `spock` configurations are defined by simple and familiar class-based structures. This allows `spock` to 
support inheritance, read from multiple markdown formats, and allow hierarchical configuration by composition.

## Quick Install

Supports Python 3.6+

```bash
pip install spock-config
```

## What's New

See [Releases](https://github.com/fidelity/spock/releases) for more information.

#### November 25th, 2020

* Addition of [Advanced Types](docs/advanced_features/Advanced-Types.md)
* Bumped support to include Python 3.9
* Checks for circular dependencies in composed config files
* Pickle support for dynamically created `spock` class

## Documentation

Current documentation and more information can be found [here](https://fidelity.github.io/spock/).

Example `spock` usage is located [here](https://github.com/fidelity/spock/blob/master/examples).

## Key Features

* Simple Declaration: Type checked parameters are defined within a `@spock` decorated class. Supports required/optional 
and automatic defaults.
* Easily Managed Parameter Groups: Each class automatically generates its own object within a single namespace.
* Parameter Inheritance: Classes support inheritance allowing for complex configurations derived from a common base 
set of parameters.
* Multiple Configuration File Types: Configurations are specified from YAML, TOML, or JSON files.
* Hierarchical Configuration: Composed from multiple configuration files via simple include statements.
* Command-Line Overrides: Quickly experiment by overriding a value with automatically generated command line arguments.
* Immutable: All classes are *frozen* preventing any misuse or accidental overwrites.
* Tractability and Reproducibility: Save currently running parameter configuration with a single chained command.
