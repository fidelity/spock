`spock` is a framework that helps manage complex parameter configurations during research and development of Python 
applications. `spock` lets you focus on the code you need to write instead of re-implementing boilerplate code like 
creating ArgParsers, reading configuration files, implementing traceability etc.


These pages contain the Python API reference of `spock` including both public and private methods/classes, etc. Please 
refer to [Quick Start](Quick-Start.md) for getting started with `spock`.
